For set 2 question

Q1: Show that the condition number κ(A) of the invertible matrix A satisfies κ(A) ≥ 1.

D1: By inequilty thum ||A * A^{-1}|| <= ||A|| * ||A^{-1}|| and we can clearly know that A*A^{-1} = I, so the norm of I will be 1. Therefore, 1 <= <= ||A|| * ||A^{-1}||

Q2: Give examples of a) strictly diagonally dominant matrices by rows; b) symmetric positive definite marices. Justify your examples.

D2: For a) Ex of strictly diagonally dominanat:
	105   5     2     2     3
	5   104     3     4     1
	5     4   105     4     4
	4     2     1   101     1
	2     4     4     1   101 

For b) The defination of symmetric positive definite marices is that it has to be symmetric and eigenvalues are positive. That means x^T * A x has to be larger than 0. 
Ex: 
	2  -1  0
	-1  2  -1
	0  -1   2
We will justify by two matlab functions:   -------
1. Positive_definite([2,-1,0;-1,2,-1;0,-1,2]) this code can test Positive_definite.
2. IsDiagDom( [ 105 5 2; 5 104 3; 5 4 105] ) is for testing strictly diagonally dominant.

Q3:Show that if matrix A, n × n is strictly diagonally dominanat by rows, then Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods converge for the solution of Au = f for any intial guess u0.

D3:for testing this strictly diagonally dominant, we can jsut use sor code by set omega to 1.
 sor([ 105 5 2; 5 104 3; 5 4 105],[1;2;3],[0;0;0], 5, 1, 1)
