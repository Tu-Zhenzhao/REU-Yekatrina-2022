For set 2 question

Q1: Show that the condition number κ(A) of the invertible matrix A satisfies κ(A) ≥ 1.

D1: By inequilty thum ||A * A^{-1}|| <= ||A|| * ||A^{-1}|| and we can clearly know that A*A^{-1} = I, so the norm of I will be 1. Therefore, 1 <= <= ||A|| * ||A^{-1}||

Q2: Give examples of a) strictly diagonally dominant matrices by rows; b) symmetric positive definite marices. Justify your examples.

D2: For a) Ex of strictly diagonally dominanat:
	105   5     2     2     3
	5   104     3     4     1
	5     4   105     4     4
	4     2     1   101     1
	2     4     4     1   101 

For b) The defination of symmetric positive definite marices is that it has to be symmetric and eigenvalues are positive. That means x^T * A x has to be larger than 0. 
Ex: 
	2  -1  0
	-1  2  -1
	0  -1   2
We will justify by two matlab functions:   -------
